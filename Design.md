# Monkey Vroom Vroom

You are a monkey swinging on vines. The goal is to get as far as possible. There will be a global leaderboard, and the game will get progressively harder the farther you go.

## Difficulty Progression

Some ways the game will become harder as you progress:
- While swinging back and forth on the vine, the pace increases (making it harder to time a jump).
- Obstacles appear (e.g., a bird might fly by, and you have to wait for it to pass or jump over it).
- Jump distances will vary.

## Purpose

- An entertaining game that engages the user by giving them an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master experience.
- Aiming for high replay value through the leaderboard and progressively challenging gameplay.

## Mechanics

### Movement
- The player swings from vine to vine, timing their jumps to avoid obstacles and reach farther distances.
- Controls for jumping and swinging will be a single-tap to jump.
//
KZ: The description "time a jump" is kinda vague. So the swing will give momentum to the swinging monkey and the player will need to decide how much momentum the monkey needs(so the monkey will be thrown in a more parabolic way?)? Will the vine swinging be different or will they all have the same speed? Is the entire vine swinging or it just the monkey? Also the path of swing would be better if it's around 1/4 of a circle directed to the front/up (> half a circle would take too much time and thus start to feel annoying)

vine would swing automatically, whole thing is swinging. your idea for a path is good
//

### Obstacles
- Birds and other animals will occasionally fly across the path, requiring players to time their jumps carefully.
- Certain vines may move or be shorter, affecting jump timing and difficulty.
//
KZ: 
just to clarify can players skip over vines? So the monkey just needs to touch any part of the next vine to catch it?  
can birds touch the monkey before the monkey takes off? 

yes, no
//


## Scoring

- Points are based on distance traveled.
- Additional points from getting collectables.

## Additional Features

- **Leaderboard**: A global ranking system that shows the top players based on distance achieved.

## Art Style

- Simple, cartoonish style to keep the game lighthearted and approachable.
- Bright and engaging visuals that appeal to a wide range of audiences.
// 
KZ: The monkey should be positioned on the left hand side instead of the middle if the game is not planning to add obstacles coming from the back. This will give the player more space to see what is coming up.
